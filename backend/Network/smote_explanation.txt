SMOTE is a statistical technique used for increasing the number of samples of the minority classes in a balanced way to counter class imbalace problem
This approach generates new examples that combine features of the target case with features of its neighbors and makes the samples more general
The minority classes in our dataset are: 0, 6, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47
if the Oversampling factor for a class is x the no. of samples in that class will be scaled to x times the no. of samples in the majority class
The Auto_SMOTE option will set the oversampling factor as 0.6 for all the minority classes
